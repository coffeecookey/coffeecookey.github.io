[{"content":"I still can\u0026rsquo;t believe that my blog is finally up! I already have so many ideas for this website like adding a page for my resume, a project showcase of sorts etc. and while I\u0026rsquo;m excited to implement those, I\u0026rsquo;d be lying if I said I wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared of the code. Having 5 mental brakdowns and 3 deleted blogsites in a span of 2 days really did make me feel like a true programmer though.\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m glad this website is up and super excited to play around with the code (and hopefully not break anything)!\nDSA progress I\u0026rsquo;ve also been devoting my time to studying C++ and its fundamentals so that I can move to DSA concepts and questions. So far, I haven\u0026rsquo;t technically started DSA but I have covered references, pointers, arrays, etc., and solved a few Hackerrank questions. My goal by the end of this year is to have a decent understanding of DSA and machine learning (which I\u0026rsquo;ve also done a little bit). I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to do enough DSA to tackle easy to medium-level Leetcode problems. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m way in over my head but hey, at least I have direction!\nI do feel a little happy when I think about my skills from 8 months ago. I could just barely solve string questions in Python and now I\u0026rsquo;m working with memory addresses, linear regression, pointers, etc. Time really does fly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been following this course from Udemy and I really like the teaching style. I\u0026rsquo;ve covered most of the first section and I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to solve at least one question every day.\nFun fact about me, I really like note-taking and documenting what I\u0026rsquo;m coding mostly because I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;ll forget the logic behind the code. It\u0026rsquo;s very time consuming but it has really helped me so far. It also leads to extremely long codes that are technically 20% code and 80% comments about the code, especially in machine learning!\nEnd sems It\u0026rsquo;s been over a month since our mid sems and we still haven\u0026rsquo;t received our scores which sucks because that makes it harder to determine each professor\u0026rsquo;s checking style but also, very amusing to see that it\u0026rsquo;s not just us students who are slacking off!\nFor the end sems, I\u0026rsquo;m mostly worried about Stats and Environmental Studies (yes, it sounds like a childish subject but the chemical reactions are hellish) but we did get a lot of preparatory leaves, which I will fully take advantage of.\nBetween end sem prep, classes, and personal pursuits, I\u0026rsquo;ve been chugging coffee down every morning and evening in an attempt to feel energized, which I do, for about an hour or two. After that, I collapse into my bed and let future me worry about my progress.\nI also wanted to take up reading, there\u0026rsquo;s a book I\u0026rsquo;ve been dying to finish called Becoming Bangalore by Roopa Pai but I guess I can wait for my exams to end before I finish it.\n","permalink":"https://coffeecookey.github.io/blog/docs/posts/2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI still can\u0026rsquo;t believe that my blog is finally up!

My name is Tanisha and I am a first year B.Tech IT student at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).\nMy college keeps me very busy (the travel time alone is exhausting enough haha) but when I\u0026rsquo;m not focusing on academics, you\u0026rsquo;ll find me dabbling in design (check out my Behance), reading a book or making art! If I\u0026rsquo;m feeling super ambitious, you\u0026rsquo;ll catch me studying about machine learning, cryptocurrancy or cybersecurity.\nI also enjoy playing games from time to time, the cozier the better! My current favourites would be Stardew Valley, Genshin Impact and Minecraft. And when I\u0026rsquo;m tired of everything around me, my go-to escape is listening to music - especially this playlist.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve made it this far, thank you dear reader.
