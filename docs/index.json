[{"content":"(1/2)\nThis post is part of a series of posts. This post discusses the introduction and design aspects of the game.\nClick here for the 2nd post.\nIntroduction This summer, I got the opportunity to go to the National University of Singapore (NUS) and attend a course called \u0026lsquo;The Structure \u0026amp; Interpretation of Computer Programs\u0026rsquo;. This course was an introduction to programming methodology, wherein we were supposed to understand basic concepts of programming and submit a final project towards the end.\nMost people (including our team) decided to develop a game. After days of endless discussion as to what would be the most interesting and feasible idea, my team and I decided to develop a two-dimensional version of the popular game \u0026lsquo;Portal\u0026rsquo; as part of out project. The part about feasibility was of great importance, since the interesting part about working on this project was that we had to use a completely new language called Source. Luckily, this language was derived from JavaScript and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel all that unfamiliar.\nThis course was 21 days long and all teams began their project work after the 11th day, as did we. To be honest, we were initially underconfident in our idea since:\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t have any game development experience to begin with If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever played Portal before, you can guess that a crazy amount of physics would be needed to make it work We just learned about this new language 5 days ago AND it has its own modules and libraries! Thankfully, the project turned out okay, better than we had imagined!\nGame concept Exit Protocol is a 2D, puzzle based platformer game based on the popular game \u0026lsquo;Portal\u0026rsquo;. In our version, the main character has to retrieve a keycard and bring it to the exit block in order to advance to the next level. The player can achieve this by creating a pair of portals! The player can enter one portal and exit the other one. Each new level is trickier than the previous one. Some levels contain buttons, doors, cubes etc. making the game more challenging and fun!\nWorking with source Source has its own libraries, which can be found here. Most people used the arcade_2d module, but due to its lack of support for physics-based functions, we ended up using the unity_academy module. This did pose some interesting challenges for us, for example, in portal, one can use the mouse cursor to aim where they want to shoot the portal. Since the unity_academy module did not support the detection of mouse-based inputs, we had to stick to keyboard inputs. I did consider pitching that we shift to arcade_2d on several occasions but decided against it since we had already worked on so much of the code in unity_academy.\nThe Assets Main character For the assets, we tried our best to make original designs. For the main character, I was inspired by a few Pinterest posts and a Winx Club character (Tecna), so I chose pink hair and green-blue eyes. I made the basic character art using a website called Pixilart and then had ChatGPT create a sprite sheet for it.\nBlocks \u0026amp; Background The ground, exit \u0026amp; keycard blocks were pretty generic. Since Portal is set in a dystopian future, inside a testing facility which is similar to a lab, we decided to make greyish ground blocks. To set it apart, we decided to play around and make our version more cyberpunk. We actively utilised colours like shades of purple, blue, grey, orange and white throughout the design phase. Initially, we thought about making the game very black, white and grey, to make it seem more like a laboratory. We soon realized that this would make our game dull, and so we decided to lean into the cyberpunk aesthetic and added more colours to other blocks. Interestingly enough, some of these colours weren\u0026rsquo;t just for a decorative purpose. For example, we added colour-coordinated buttons and doors to make the game a little harder to solve!\nUI - Help buttons and tutorials We decided to keep this section simple and chose colors that would contrast with the background. Since the background was blue-green, white was a perfect fit. It took us a while to find the perfect shade of orange that would go with the background, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to think that we did a pretty good job with the color scheme overall!\nTo learn more about the coding aspect, check out the next post!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:49537/blog/docs/posts/nus-sicp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e(1/2)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post is part of a series of posts.

I already have so many ideas for this website like adding a page for my resume, a project showcase of sorts etc. and while I\u0026rsquo;m excited to implement those, I\u0026rsquo;d be lying if I said I wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared of the code. Having 5 mental brakdowns and 3 deleted blogsites in a span of 2 days really did make me feel like a true programmer though.\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m glad this website is up and super excited to play around with the code (and hopefully not break anything)!\nDSA progress I\u0026rsquo;ve also been devoting my time to studying C++ and its fundamentals so that I can move to DSA concepts and questions. So far, I haven\u0026rsquo;t technically started DSA but I have covered references, pointers, arrays, etc., and solved a few Hackerrank questions. My goal by the end of this year is to have a decent understanding of DSA and machine learning (which I\u0026rsquo;ve also done a little bit). I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to do enough DSA to tackle easy to medium-level Leetcode problems. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m way in over my head but hey, at least I have direction!\nI do feel a little happy when I think about my skills from 8 months ago. I could just barely solve string questions in Python and now I\u0026rsquo;m working with memory addresses, linear regression, pointers, etc. Time really does fly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been following this course from Udemy and I really like the teaching style. I\u0026rsquo;ve covered most of the first section and I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to solve at least one question every day.\nFun fact about me, I really like note-taking and documenting what I\u0026rsquo;m coding mostly because I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;ll forget the logic behind the code. It\u0026rsquo;s very time consuming but it has really helped me so far. It also leads to extremely long codes that are technically 20% code and 80% comments about the code, especially in machine learning!\nEnd sems It\u0026rsquo;s been over a month since our mid sems and we still haven\u0026rsquo;t received our scores which sucks because that makes it harder to determine each professor\u0026rsquo;s checking style but also, very amusing to see that it\u0026rsquo;s not just us students who are slacking off!\nFor the end sems, I\u0026rsquo;m mostly worried about Stats and Environmental Studies (yes, it sounds like a childish subject but the chemical reactions are hellish) but we did get a lot of preparatory leaves, which I will fully take advantage of.\nBetween end sem prep, classes, and personal pursuits, I\u0026rsquo;ve been chugging coffee down every morning and evening in an attempt to feel energized, which I do, for about an hour or two. After that, I collapse into my bed and let future me worry about my progress.\nI also wanted to take up reading, there\u0026rsquo;s a book I\u0026rsquo;ve been dying to finish called Becoming Bangalore by Roopa Pai but I guess I can wait for my exams to end before I finish it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:49537/blog/docs/posts/2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI still can\u0026rsquo;t believe that my blog is finally up!
