      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, I got the opportunity to go to the National University of Singapore (NUS) and attend a course called &amp;lsquo;The Structure &amp;amp; Interpretation of Computer Programs&amp;rsquo;. This course was an introduction to programming methodology, wherein we were supposed to understand basic concepts of programming and submit a final project towards the end. Most people (including our team) decided to develop a game. After days of endless discussion as to what would be the most interesting and feasible idea, my team and I decided to develop a two dimensional version of the popular game &amp;lsquo;Portal&amp;rsquo; as part of out project. The part about feasibility was of great importance, since the interesting part about working on this project was that we had to use a completely new language called Source. Luckily, this language was derived from JavaScript and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel all that unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
