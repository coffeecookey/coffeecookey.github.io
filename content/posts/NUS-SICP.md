## Introduction

This summer, I got the opportunity to go to the National University of Singapore (NUS) and attend a course called 'The Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs'. This course was an introduction to programming methodology, wherein we were supposed to understand basic concepts of programming and submit a final project towards the end. Most people (including our team) decided to develop a game. After days of endless discussion as to what would be the most interesting and feasible idea, my team and I decided to develop a two dimensional version of the popular game 'Portal' as part of out project. The part about feasibility was of great importance, since the interesting part about working on this project was that we had to use a completely new language called Source. Luckily, this language was derived from JavaScript and didn't feel all that unfamiliar.

This course was 21 days long and all teams began their project work after the 11th day, as did we. To be honest, we were initially underconfident in our idea since

<ul>
<li> We didn't have any game development experience to begin with</li>
<li> If you've ever played Portal before, you can guess that a crazy amount of physics would be needed to make it work </li>
<li> We just learned about this new language 5 days ago AND it has its own modules and libraries!</li>
</ul>
